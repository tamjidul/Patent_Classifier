    Tool: NASA_Patent_Classifier (NASA_PC)


1. Using 7zip combine the 05 pieces (each piece is ~20MiB) of files into one and name it "NASA_Patent_Classifier_Models.zip"

3. Read the Readme.txt file within the folder(s) and proceed accordingly.


Alternative approach:

    The size of the file is ~100MiB.    
 2. Uncompress "NASA_Patent_Classifier_Models.zip.zip" 		
 3. Read the "Readme.txt" file, found inside the folder(s) and then proceed accordingly.
